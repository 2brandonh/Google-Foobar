# Google Foobar 
> Google Foobar is Google's secret hiring challenge. Google uses this to hire some of the best developers around the globe which they think can be a good match for their organization. Many developers in Google have been hired through this hiring challenge.

These are my solutions to the projects and prompts I was given. Essentially, Google Foobar can be thought of as RPG Leetcode with an emerging story and increasingly difficult, timed problems. More details about specifications are in each problem.
